# Quoty McWalletface

Unfortunately I do not have time to provide support for this project.

Hardware: Esp32v2 Adafruit Feather and Adafruit eInk Grayscale Featherwing only. SD cards and Adafruit Nano Thermal Printer optional.

Software: You'll need to download the necessary libraries for the headers via the Arduino IDE. There are instructions in the comments in this example code in the header section as well.

This initial version features a random quote generator and a hidden menu if you press all three top buttons at the same time on the eInk Feather Wing: 1) a PSBT signer 2) a Wallet Generator 3) a Flashlight.


Coming soon: an EMF Detector version

Coming eventually: a 3D printer file for a case.
